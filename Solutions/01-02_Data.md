DATA
==============

Let's first take a look at the data at our disposal. The authors identified a number of gene markers across organisms
representing all known biodiversity. Find them by:

~~~
$ ls ~/data/phylogenomics/Exercise1/
~~~

Copy the fasta files to your home directory (e.g. in a folder called "Day5_phylogenomics") and explore them:
~~~
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p Day5_phylogenomics/Exercise1/Data
$ cd Day5_phylogenomics/Exercise1/Data/
$ cp ~/data/phylogenomics/Exercise1/Data/*.faa .
~~~
- How many gene markers were used in this study?
~~~
  $ ls *.faa | wc -l
30

Thirty gene markers were used in this study. They correspond to specific COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Genes).

- How many organisms were included per gene marker?

Between 580 and 600 sequences per gene marker (with one exception at 489 sequences)
~~~  
- How many organisms were included in total?
~~~
# Note: the FASTA headers contain more information than just the species the gene belongs to
# To count only species names, we need to get rid of the rest of the header
$ grep --no-filename ">" *.faa | sed 's/|.*//' | sort -u | wc -l
612

612 organisms
~~~  


Find the domains to which each organism belongs in the file 'org_domains.tsv'. Are the three domains of life 
appropriately represented? Do you think this is a good dataset to reconstruct the tree of life?
~~~
$ cut -f2 ~/data/phylogenomics/Exercise1/Data/org_domains.tsv | sort | uniq -c
    442 Archaea
     98 Bacteria
     72 Eukarya

There are many more Archaea than organisms from the other two domains. While this dataset could be
appropriate to establish the position of Eukaryotes within Archaea (where exploring the archaeal diversity
is a positive aspect), it would not be a bad idea to do an analysis of this kind where the organisms
of the three domains are more balanced.
