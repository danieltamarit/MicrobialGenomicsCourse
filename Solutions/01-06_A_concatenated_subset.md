A concatenated subset
==============

The results of the previous step probably made you notice
that not all the genes seem to support equally both hypotheses
for the tree of life.

Re-do the concatenation step with a subset of the gene markers
and reconstruct a new phylogeny using, again, FastTree.
What do you see? Explain your results.

> The new tree should show a different topology, by which Eukaryotes are nested within Archaea. Probably close to Asgard archaea. This tree is consistent with newer results indicating that the eukaryotic ancestor was an archaeon that acquired mitochondria, nucleus, and many other typically eukaryotic features.
