A concatenated subset
==============

The results of the previous step probably made you notice
that not all the genes seem to support equally both hypotheses
for the tree of life. It is likely that one or more of the gene
markers were wrongly selected.

Let's check if removing these gene markers from our dataset
makes a difference in our results. Re-do the concatenation step 
with a subset of the gene markers. Use all gene markers except for
those that you suspect are wrong. Then, reconstruct a new phylogeny
using, again, FastTree.

What do you see? Explain your results.
