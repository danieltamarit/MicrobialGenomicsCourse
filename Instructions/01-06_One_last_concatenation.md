One last concatenation
==============

The results of the previous step probably made you notice
that not all the genes seem to support equally both hypotheses
for the tree of life.

Re-do the concatenation step with a subset of the gene markers
and reconstruct a new phylogeny using, again, FastTree.
What do you see? Explain your results.
