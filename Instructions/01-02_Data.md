DATA
==============

Let's first take a look at the data at our disposal. The authors identified a number of gene markers across organisms
representing all known biodiversity. Find them by:

~~~
$ ls ~/data/phylogenomics/Exercise1/
~~~

Copy the fasta files to your home directory (e.g. in a folder called "Day5_phylogenomics/Exercise1/Fasta") and explore them:
- How many gene markers were used in this study?
- How many organisms were included per gene marker?
- How many organisms were included in total?

Find the domains to which each organism belongs in the file 'org_domains.tsv'. Are the three domains of life 
appropriately represented? Do you think this is a good dataset to reconstruct the tree of life?
